Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the [JOB_TITLE] position at [COMPANY_NAME]. As a Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo with extensive experience in full-stack development, data engineering, and software automation, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team.

Through my recent role as a Full-Stack Engineer at Rundoo, I gained valuable experience building scalable Go services and React applications for enterprise-level systems. I successfully built REST/gRPC APIs serving B2B traffic, owned end-to-end systems deployed across 200+ enterprise stores, and shipped 40+ PRs per month while rapidly adapting from zero Go experience to full-time engineer velocity. This experience has strengthened my abilities in backend development, system design, and high-velocity software delivery.

My background also includes significant data engineering experience at Scotiabank, where I built and optimized 20+ GCP Airflow pipelines across banking domains and cut P95 end-to-end runtime by 30\%, and at DataPower, where I engineered ETL workflows that improved system throughput by 30\%. My software automation work at Ford Motor Company, where I automated 250+ system tests and increased embedded system reliability by 500\%, has further developed my testing and DevOps capabilities.

I am particularly drawn to [COMPANY_NAME] because of [COMPANY_REASON]. The [JOB_TITLE] role aligns perfectly with my technical background and career goals, and I am eager to apply my skills in [RELEVANT_SKILLS] to contribute to your team's success.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience and enthusiasm can contribute to [COMPANY_NAME]'s continued success.

Sincerely,
Jenny Hui
