Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the [JOB_TITLE] position at [COMPANY_NAME]. As a Mathematical Physics student at the University of Waterloo with extensive experience in machine learning, data science, and software development, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team.

Through my recent role as a Machine Learning Engineer at Cash App, I gained valuable experience scaling fraud detection systems and building AI-driven automation pipelines. I successfully scaled fraud training data 20x using multi-agent AI systems and improved detection precision by 15\% while reducing analyst workload by 80\%. This experience has strengthened my abilities in ML engineering, data processing, and production system optimization.

My background also includes significant research experience at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, where I worked on quantum foundations and causal inference, and data science work at Intact Data Lab, where I prevented \$3.1M in annual costs through causal ML interventions. Leading a 15-person technical team at WAT.ai has further developed my project management and collaboration skills.

I am particularly drawn to [COMPANY_NAME] because of [COMPANY_REASON]. The [JOB_TITLE] role aligns perfectly with my technical background and career goals, and I am eager to apply my skills in [RELEVANT_SKILLS] to contribute to your team's success.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience and enthusiasm can contribute to [COMPANY_NAME]'s continued success.

Sincerely,
Dvir Zagury-Grynbaum
