RPB delivers environmental and occupational ionizing radiation protection programs as well as complementary nuclear security and emergency functions. In this respect, Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are also of interest to Health Canada, given our role in reviewing impact assessments (IA) from the perspective of public health. The Canadian Standards Association environmental transfer model (N288.1) is very helpful in this respect for regular sized reactors; however, we anticipate that additional tools will be required to support IAs for SMRs.",

A section of this work will be to analyze the movement of radioactive contaminants and chemical behaviour of isotopes through the atmosphere and ground. The literature search portion of the project is almost completed and the report may require some final touches.\nYou will assist the research scientist in continuing to develop a model for this type of environmental transfer by performing calculations using Microsoft Excel and possibly other programs.\nAnother task may be to assist in compiling and analyzing data describing radioactivity levels in caribou samples.\nThis position will require proficiency in reading, evaluating data, gathering scientific research, and analyzing scientific literature. In this role, you will develop valuable experience in understanding environmental pathways, specifically through permafrost soils and the atmosphere. You will also gain a wide range of knowledge in contaminant behaviour, its chemical nature, and interaction through various ecosystems. An important goal of this research is to advance knowledge in Arctic and northern regions with respect to environmental contaminants.

No two experiences are alike and the skills you acquire will position you for\nsuccess within and outside of BCG.\nBCG is staffed by consultants who combine industry experience with acute strategic and analytical skills.\nThey come from a variety of backgrounds, reflecting the diversity of perspective we value. Most\nassignments involve one or more teams of three to six BCGers; specifically, the typical BCG team is made\nup of one to two partners, a project manager, and several consultants/associates who work with a similar\ngroup of client staff. The standard team combines consultants with relevant technical and industry\nbackgrounds with others who have functional and strategic skills. We also strive to incorporate a mix of\nseniority and skills to balance the capabilities needed for the project with a sound budget plan. We create\nvalue by customizing our approach to complement client capabilities and the issues at hand.\nWe believe consulting is a process, not a product. Our goal is to guide, develop, facilitate, and enrich each\nclient's strategy development process. Our consulting practice depends on close teamwork between the\nclient's organization and our staff. Clients often remark that a valuable and unusual aspect of working with\nBCG is the firm's commitment to joint discovery of insights and strategies, and to building the experience\nbase and skills of its client's organization. Team interaction centers on intensive analysis of objective data\nand open discussion of logic and conclusions. This type of collaborative work is complemented by objective\nresearch of the competitive environment, including competitor analysis and capability benchmarking.\nOur teams work with client members from all levels of the organization in order to integrate our staff's\nstrategy, operational, and industry experience with the client's knowledge of its particular situation, culture,\nand constraints. To ensure follow-through by a client, we find it vital to closely link BCG's senior managers\nwith the highest level of the client's organization responsible for acting on the outcomes of our involvement.\nIndividual assignments can last anywhere from two to twelve months or more, depending on the complexity\nof the challenges and the client's needs. We usually break each project into modular phases so that our\nclients see results well before the engagement's end. Assignments normally proceed through three stages\nover a period of several months: 1) identifying and analyzing opportunities for change and laying out\ndifferent options for senior management to consider, 2) fleshing out the best options in order to create\ndetailed action plans, and 3) assisting in execution. We believe that working with a client until results are\nassured is vital to their success.",

Over the course of your internship, you will explore ways to approach and solve exciting problems within your field of interest through fun and challenging classes, interactive sessions, guest speakers, and group discussions.\nYou will also have the chance to put those lessons to practical use, pairing up with full-time Jane Street employees who act as mentors and collaborate with you on real-world projects we actually need done.\nIf you've never thought about a career in finance, you're in good company. Many of us were in the same position before working here. If you have a curious mind, a collaborative spirit, and a passion for solving interesting problems, we have a feeling you'll fit right in.",
            "job_responsibilities": "About the position\nAs a Quantitative Trading Intern, you'll be paired with experienced traders who will teach you how to identify market signals, analyze and execute strategies, construct quantitative models, conduct statistical analysis, and build trading intuition. You'll work on projects alongside mentors in two different areas of trading, giving you a sense of the variety of problems we solve every day. In the past, these projects have included conducting studies on new or existing datasets, building quantitative models, writing tools, and even considering big-picture questions that we're still trying to figure out.\nThroughout the summer, you'll also participate in dozens of simulated interactive team-based mock trading sessions. These will expose you to many of the dynamics we observe in real markets, illustrate the role that we play in making markets more efficient, and help build intuition for how we think about both trading and collaborating.\nThis work is reinforced with intensive classes on the broader fundamentals of markets and trading, workshops on various tools we use, and interactive lunch seminars with senior traders. During the second half of the internship, you will also get to participate in one \"elective\" based on your interests. Electives consist of targeted classes and immersive activities, and are designed to give you a deeper and more nuanced look into one of the many aspects of what trading and research can look like at Jane Street:\nAlgorithmic Trading and Market Microstructure\nYou'll learn the end-to-end process of developing an algorithmic trading strategy. While being mentored by full-time traders, you'll analyze market data to develop a tradable fair value and implement a trading strategy in Python. Your algorithmic strategy will connect directly to simulated markets with different market structures, and you will learn how to optimize your strategy given the unique attributes of each market. Through classes and immersive activities, you'll explore how various market dynamics affect strategy behavior and learn how real-world trading differs from simulation.\nTrading Strategy and Scenarios\nEach week, you'll be introduced to a new trading scenario inspired by real events on a particular trading desk. You'll work in teams on multiple mock trading sessions related to each scenario and use the time between sessions to refine your strategy, write recaps, and hear how the story played out in real life from our seasoned full-time traders who lived through it.\nModeling, Machine Learning, and Data Science\nYou'll learn how Jane Street applies advanced machine learning and statistical techniques to model and predict large datasets. Through a series of classes and activities, you will analyze things such as real trading data, simulated market data, and prediction markets. You'll gain an understanding of the differences between textbook machine learning and its application to noisy and complex financial data.",
